# 🩺 Smart Device for Early Detection of Cardiopathy-Induced Stress Condition

## 📖 Overview  
This project presents a **Smart Health Monitoring System** designed to detect **cardiopathy-induced stress conditions** in real-time. The device continuously monitors vital parameters such as **Heart Rate**, **SpO₂**, **Blood Pressure**, **ECG**, and **Body Temperature**, offering timely alerts for abnormal readings.  

By integrating **IoT** and **machine learning**, the system aims to support **early detection** and **preventive healthcare**.
